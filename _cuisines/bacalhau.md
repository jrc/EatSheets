description: Portugal is the world’s top consumer of codfish, importing it from the North Atlantic in vast quantities and making it their own. Bacalhau (literally “cod”) normally refers to salt cod, produced by salting and drying the fish. This preservation technique was crucial in the days when the Portuguese roamed the world’s seas.
